## 🚀 Built a Secure Local Voting App with Flutter! 🗳️

I've been diving deep into Flutter UI development, and my latest project is a voting app that allows users to:</br>

✅ Create a vote locally</br>
✅ Cast their votes securely</br>
✅ View real-time results</br>
✅ Ensure security with a PIN system</br>

For state management and data storage, I used GetX and Get Storage, making the app smooth and efficient. 🔥</br>
This project was a great learning experience in handling user authentication, local data persistence, and UI/UX design.</br>
